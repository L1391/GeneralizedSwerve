# Generalized Swerve 

This repository hold the Processing code for a generalized swerve visualizer.

### Assumptions
* The arrangement of the wheels forms a convex shape
* The centroid of said shape is the center of mass

### Process

The algorithm adds to the existing swerve math by making the wheels farther from the centroid have a proportionally faster turning-vector than the wheels closer to the centroid.
